Ontario Grid Forecasting – Renewable Energy Analytics 

This project analyzes hourly electricity generation data from Ontario’s power grid to track renewable vs. non-renewable energy trends and forecast future demand. It leverages a fully automated cloud-based ETL pipeline using Python, Airflow, and BigQuery, with insights presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

The goal is to support data-driven energy planning in alignment with Canada's renewable energy transition by providing real-time visibility into generation patterns, regional mix, and demand forecasting.
